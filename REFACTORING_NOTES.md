# Projects Component Refactoring

## Overview

The `projects.tsx` component has been refactored to improve maintainability, performance, and code organization. The original monolithic component has been broken down into smaller, focused components and utilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Separation

- **`ProjectCard.tsx`**: Extracted card rendering logic into a reusable component
- **`ProjectDialog.tsx`**: Extracted dialog/modal logic into a separate component
- **`projects.tsx`**: Simplified main component that orchestrates the other components

### 2. Type Safety

- **`types/project.ts`**: Created a centralized type definition for the Project interface
- Added proper TypeScript types throughout all components
- Improved type safety for image handling and responsive layouts

### 3. Custom Hooks

- **`hooks/useResponsiveLayout.ts`**: Extracted responsive layout logic into a reusable hook
- Memoized calculations to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Centralized breakpoint logic for better maintainability

### 4. Utilities

- **`utils/imageUtils.ts`**: Centralized image management and imports
- Created a single source of truth for all project images
- Added utility functions for image handling

### 5. Performance Improvements

- Used `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Used `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Memoized projects data to prevent re-creation on every render
- Improved key generation for list items

### 6. Accessibility Enhancements

- Added proper accessibility labels and hints
- Improved screen reader support
- Added semantic structure to interactive elements

### 7. Code Organization

- Separated concerns (UI, logic, data)
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved readability and maintainability
- Added proper JSDoc comments

## File Structure

```
components/
├── ProjectCard.tsx          # Individual project card component
├── ProjectDialog.tsx        # Project details dialog component
└── ScreenContainer.tsx      # Existing container component

hooks/
└── useResponsiveLayout.ts   # Responsive layout calculations

types/
└── project.ts              # Project interface definition

utils/
└── imageUtils.ts           # Image management utilities

app/(app)/
└── projects.tsx            # Main projects page (simplified)
```

## Benefits

### Maintainability

- Smaller, focused components are easier to understand and modify
- Clear separation of concerns
- Centralized type definitions prevent inconsistencies

### Performance

- Memoized calculations reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized event handlers
- Better key generation for list items

### Developer Experience

- Better TypeScript support with proper types
- Clearer component structure
- Easier to test individual components
- Better error handling and debugging

### Accessibility

- Improved screen reader support
- Better semantic structure
- Proper ARIA labels and hints

## Migration Notes

- All existing functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to the public API
- Image paths and data structure remain the same
- Styling and visual appearance unchanged

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for individual components
- Implement error boundaries
- Add loading states for images
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large project lists
- Add search/filter functionality
- Implement project categories or tags
